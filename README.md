This is the project repository for Team 6 of YWCC 307 for the spring semester of 2024 at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.  

## Project Summary
To be brief, our group has been charged to produce a proposal for a commercial application in social finance.  
For reference, the full prompt is: ![scenario](https://github.com/nb538/ywcc307-114Team6/assets/156876990/ae500ab9-d254-4404-8c78-49b1357c7fb6 "Project Scenario").  
As can be discerned from our Meeting Minutes, our group has decided to create a proposal for an app designed to aggrgegate charities into one application for easy access to the consumer.  
The profitability for this app comes from the selling of adspace to private companies as well as the offer of sponsored promotions to participating charities and nonprofit organizations.  
The benefit to the consumer is we simplify and streamline their ability to donate to their charity of choice as well as aggregating the data for them in one concise document for tax benefits come the following tax season.  
The presentation can be found at this link: [Charity and Nonprofit Aggregation Proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10vlBNS5EXQ8gXErd8k1dyAtJ5l9CXQcpNzfHP97yPT8/edit#slide=id.p "Google Slides Presentation").
